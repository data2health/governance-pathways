CTSAs need clear pathways and guidance to navigate data governance in order to share data with individual researchers and across institutions. We can help organizations define how they can best share data, and provide examples and templates of standardized Data Use Agreements (DUAs) to make it easier for hubs to share data with researchers. 
This project aims to create a library of standardized agreements used across CTSA hubs and related communities, disseminate best practice information, create and pilot data sharing agreement for specific use cases that can be flexibly populated as a template, and "Pathways" documentation for CTSA hubs to aid decision making and authoritative data sharing. The ultimate goal is to ease collaborative and flexible data sharing across the whole of the CTSA consortium.
